# 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

## Issue: SyntaxError - Identifier 'SocialCalc' has already been declared

### Problem:
Mixed namespace initialization patterns caused conflicts:
- Some files used: `const SocialCalc = window.SocialCalc || (window.SocialCalc = {});`
- Other files used: `var SocialCalc; if (!SocialCalc) SocialCalc = {};`

### Solution:
Standardized all files to use the compatible `var` pattern to avoid const/var conflicts.

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `src/js/core/constants.js` - Changed const to var declaration
- ✅ `src/js/core/number-formatter.js` - Changed const to var declaration

## Issue: TypeError - Cannot set properties of undefined

### Problem:
HTML files tried to set properties on SocialCalc objects before they were initialized:
```javascript
SocialCalc.Callbacks.broadcast = (a, b) => {}; // Error: Callbacks is undefined
```

### Solution:
Added safety checks to ensure objects exist before setting properties.

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `src/html/test-workbook.html` - Added Callbacks object check
- ✅ `src/html/test-graph.html` - Added Constants/Popup object checks

## Issue: 404 Image Errors - Images Not Found

### Problem:
JavaScript was looking for images at `/src/html/images/` but images are actually located at `/src/images/`.

### Solution:
Fixed image path configuration in multiple locations:

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `src/html/test-workbook.html` - Set correct image prefix
- ✅ `src/html/test-graph.html` - Updated image path configuration  
- ✅ `src/js/core/constants.js` - Fixed defaultImagePrefix and CSS background paths

**Changes Made:**
```javascript
// Before
defaultImagePrefix: "images/sc-"

// After  
defaultImagePrefix: "../images/sc-"
```

## Issue: Uncaught SyntaxError - Unexpected end of input

### Problem:
The `test-graph.html` file had incomplete JavaScript with missing closing braces for the `addEventListener` callback function.

### Solution:
- Fixed incomplete JavaScript structure
- Added missing closing braces for `addEventListener` callback
- Properly indented code and modernized variable declarations
- Converted `var` to `const` for immutable values

**File Fixed:**
- ✅ `src/html/test-graph.html` - Completed JavaScript structure

## Issue: 404 Script Errors - Missing Files in test-highcharts.html

### Problem:
The `test-highcharts.html` and `test-sparklines.html` files hadn't been modernized and were still pointing to old file paths that no longer exist.

### Solution:
Completely rewrote both HTML files with:
- Modern HTML5 structure
- Correct script paths to new folder organization
- Updated jQuery to 3.6.0
- Modern CSS and JavaScript patterns
- Proper event handling with `addEventListener`
- ARIA attributes for accessibility

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `src/html/test-highcharts.html` - Complete rewrite with modern structure
- ✅ `src/html/test-sparklines.html` - Complete rewrite with modern structure

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

All HTML test files now use the modernized folder structure and should load without errors!

### Expected Behavior After Fix:
- ✅ No more "already declared" errors
- ✅ No more "Cannot set properties" errors  
- ✅ Clean console output
- ✅ Basic spreadsheet interface loads

### If You Still See Issues:
1. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** 
3. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors
4. **Verify file paths** are correct for your server setup
